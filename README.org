* Oh my goodness!
What, you ask, is this?

An ~orary~ is a contraption that describes the motions of astral bodies. It's a
mechanism -- a contrivance. It's neat as hell.

This thing plots the motions of my Emacs configs. It is made with:

1. Strong opinions about good ways for Emacs to behave -- like white space
   tidying and an aversion to tabs and good spell checking.
2. A lot of know-how inherited from wonderful smart people.
3. A whole crap ton of gifs and emoji. ヽ(⌐■_■)ノ♪♬

Should you use this? Ehhhhh maybe? Probably not? You'll probably have a vastly
nicer time with one of the aforementioned wonderful smart people's Emacs libs:

1. Bodil Stokkes' [[https://github.com/bodil/ohai-emacs][ohai-emacs]]
2. Bozhidar Batsov's [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude]]

Or, if you want to do Emacs on double-weird Vim mode, try [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]].
